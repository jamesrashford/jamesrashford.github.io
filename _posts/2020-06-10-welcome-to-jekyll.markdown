For those that have kept a beady eye on this site, you may have realised that what was my main blog (hosted at jrashford.com) has been replaced with this rather basic static page. If you're are wondering where the original blog is, I have moved it to [https://blog.jrashford.com](https://blog.jrashford.com). Fun fact, it's running off a Raspberry Pi 4. Maybe I'll write a tutorial for that.

Anyway, this move was done purely just to better organise my website and to segment my content as much as possible.

Enjoy, the new site
